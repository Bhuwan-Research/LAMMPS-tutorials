A small tutorial analyzes Stress Wave Propagation in a single-layer graphene sheet under fullerene projectile impact. 
The AIREBO potential is used in molecular dynamics software (LAMMPS) for atomic interactions. The projectile was assigned
a velocity of 3.6 km/s and hit in the middle of a fixed graphene sheet. 
The stress wave propagation in terms of planner stress is presented in the video.

To know more about the LAMMPS scripts and MATLAB codes, check out my GitHub repository () and youtube channel

This tutorial can be helpful to graduate students who are new to molecular dynamics.

Thank you.....
